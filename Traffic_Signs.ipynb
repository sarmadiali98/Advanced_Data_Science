        "The traffic sign image dataset comprises 4969 samples meticulously divided into three partsâ€”Train, Valid, and Test. Featuring distinct classes such as Green Light, Red Light, Speed Limits ranging from 10 to 120, and Stop signs, the dataset presents a valuable resource for machine learning applications. With applications in autonomous vehicle navigation, the model derived from this dataset can empower self-driving cars to accurately recognize and respond to various traffic signs, ensuring adherence to traffic regulations. Additionally, the dataset finds utility in driver assistance systems, enhancing road safety by monitoring and alerting drivers who may violate speed limits or ignore red lights. Furthermore, it can serve as a foundation for road safety training programs, enabling simulations for new drivers to better understand and respond to different traffic scenarios. Beyond individual vehicles, the dataset can contribute to smart city initiatives, allowing authorities to employ the model in connected infrastructure for real-time monitoring of traffic compliance."

The CNN model is defined with a sequential architecture consisting of a convolutional layer, a max pooling layer, a flattening layer, and two dense layers. The model is trained using images from the â€˜trainâ€™ and â€˜validâ€™ directories, and then evaluated on the â€˜validâ€™ and â€˜testâ€™ directories. The images are preprocessed using Kerasâ€™s ImageDataGenerator to rescale the pixel values. The model is trained and evaluated separately for each directory in a form of K-fold Cross Validation, where K is the number of directories. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on its accuracy on the validation and test sets. The code is designed to print the training progress and the evaluation results."
